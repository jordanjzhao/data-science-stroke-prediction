## Introduction
Research report formulated on the basis of predicting previous stroke instances in patients using attribute parameters using classification. The report communicates the ponential benefits to being able to make stroke predictions in the healthcare setting and the results from predicting previous occurances of strokes. The method includes classification 
using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm.
